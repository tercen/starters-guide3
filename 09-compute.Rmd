# Compute
In this section you perform a computation.
The projection you created in the previous section can also be used by a computation (i.e. _operator_).
This is due to the _What you see is what you compute_ paradigm. The following steps outlines how to add an _operator_.

* Click on the **Operator** tab

* Go to the **Public tab** and select  the ``PCA`` operator, click **OK**
