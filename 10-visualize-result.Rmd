* Choose a **Data step** and click **OK**

A new projection page opens. This projection page should be familiar as you have seen this before in the previous steps of the this guide. However you will notice there are additional factors in the factor list, namely PC1, PC2, etc..

* Drag-n-drop the ``PC2`` factor to the _x-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``PC3`` factor to the _y-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``sex`` and ``species`` factor to the _colors zone_
