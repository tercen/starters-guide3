["index.html", "Starter’s guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " Starter’s guide to Tercen Faris Naji, Alexandre Maurel Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using TercenCloud. it uses an example data set of morphological measurements on Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia. Why read this guide The easiest path to knowing the basics of Tercen. Acknowledgement I would like to thank all the users of Tercen and also those who have given feedback, all of which made Tercen possible. Motivation Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

Go the file at the git hub address https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tercen/getting_started/master/crabs/data/crabs_longformat.csv Click right and select Save as… Save your data on your desktop. Use the default name. Crab data description: The data set is called “crabs” and it is in a long format. It has a total of 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. It is composed of four groups (two sexes and two species) of 50 measurements for five traits variables, FL (frontal lobe size in mm), RW (rear width mm), CL (carapace length mm), CW (carapace width mm) and BD (body depth mm). In summary it is: Factor values sp species, B or O for Blue or Orange. sex M or F index index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups, 2 sex and 2 species variable one of five variables: FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement the value of one of the five variable "],

Click on Create a data set A dialog window opens which allows you to select the data file. Click on the Choose File button and select your file (i.e crabs_longformat.csv). Please make sure to select the separator, the encoding and the quote format. Selecting the separator requires you to select one of three options: Comma (default) Semicolon Tab Please select Comma for this data set. Selecting the encoding requires you to select one of two options: Latin 1 (default) UTF 8 Leave the default.

The main zones are highlighted in green below: You can create any projection by dragging-n-dropping of items in the factors list to the different zones (indicated by the color green) of the projection page. There are four zones on the right and three on the left. On the right are: y-axis zone x-axis zone column zone row zone on the left are: label zone colors zone error bar zone Drag-n-drop the measurement factor to the y-axis zone Drag-n-drop the variable factor to the row zone Drag-n-drop the observation factor to the column zone The image should look like the one above. Notice, the variable are the row and the observations are the columns.

However this projection can be further developed into multi-group pariwise. Drag-n-drop the sp factor to the column zone Drag-n-drop the sex factor to the color zone You have now completed the multi-group pairwise. This view is a powerful projection.
