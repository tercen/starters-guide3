["index.html", "Starter’s guide to Tercen Chapter 1 Introduction", " Starter’s guide to Tercen Faris Naji, Alexandre Maurel Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using Tercen. it uses an example data set of morphological measurements on Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia. Why read this guide? : It is the easiest and quickest path to understanding the basics of Tercen. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback about Tercen. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

Use the default name. Crab data description: The data set is called “crabs” and it is in a long format. It has a total of 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. It is composed of four groups (two sexes and two species) of 50 measurements for five traits variables, FL (frontal lobe size in mm), RW (rear width mm), CL (carapace length mm), CW (carapace width mm) and BD (body depth mm). In summary it is: Factor values sp species, B or O for Blue or Orange. sex M or F index index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups, 2 sex and 2 species variable one of five variables: FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement the value of one of the five variable observation index 1 to 200 observations for each variable "],

["run-operator-locally.html", "Chapter 16 Run operator locally", " Chapter 16 Run operator locally In this section you run an operator you created in a previous chapter, but now locally (i.e. on your own computer not on Tercen). To run an operator locally you require to have the ability to run R scripts (e.g. using RGui or RStudio). If this is not revelant to your work then you may skip this chapter. Again the R mean operator is used as an example. Go to the crabs workflow Right click on the “mean” data step and select Reset The step should go eventually blue. Go to the mean data step (if its not open already then double click on the mean data step) Copy the URL and identify the workflowId and stepId. The URL structure is https://tercen.com/core/index.html#ds/{workflowId}/{stepId} where workflowId and stepId is a hexadecimal number(with hyphens). An illustrative example (see figure above) is given: https://tercen.com/core/#ds/17e8d105a6da4ee5e576f271c53a91ff/d5ed0600-84b0-11e7-f956-43d96268b27b In the above URL, workflowId = 17e8d105a6da4ee5e576f271c53a91ff and stepId = d5ed0600-84b0-11e7-f956-43d96268b27b. Your URL will be different and therefore so will the workflowId and stepId. Please identify these two identifiers in your actual URL. Install rtercen package devtools::install_github(&quot;tercen/rtercen&quot;, ref = &quot;2.10&quot;) Load the appropriate libraries library(rtercen) library(plyr) Replace the long string of Xs (length 32) and the long string of Ys (length 36) indicated below with the actual workflowId and stepId values you identified previously. workflowId = &quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot; stepId = &quot;YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot; Create a Tercen client object using your actual username and password and replace UUUUUU and PPPPPP using them. client = TercenClient$new(&quot;UUUUUU&quot;&quot;, &quot;PPPPPP&quot;) Get the cube query defined by your workflow query = client$getCubeQuery(workflowId, stepId) # inspect query as json # query$toJson() Execute the query and get the data cube = query$execute() Get the data as a data frame df &lt;- cube$sourceTable$as.data.frame() Execute some computation computed.df &lt;- ddply(df, c(&quot;.ids&quot;), summarize, mean = mean(.values)) In this instance it is using the mean operator. .ids is a unqiue integer identifier given to each cell of the data and.value are the data value(s) in each cell. The projection in the mean step determines what are the cell and values. Send the result to Tercen query$setResult(computed.df) Go to the crabs workflow and refresh the web page (a quick way is to press the F5 key). The mean data step should now be green. Even though the execution has taken place locally on your computer. Open the mean results data step and check the results. It should be the same results view you obtained when the operator was run on the Tercen server in the previous chapter. In this chapter you have performed a local computation and sent the results of the computation to Tercen for viewing. More documentation can be found at https://github.com/tercen/rtercen "],
