# Run operator locally
In this section you run an operator you created in a previous chapter, but now locally (i.e. on your own computer not on Tercen). To run an operator locally you require to have the ability to run R scripts (e.g. using RGui or RStudio).

Again the R ``mean`` operator is used as an example. 

* Go to the ``crabs workflow``
* Right click on the "mean" data step and select **Reset**

The step should go eventually <span style="color:blue">__blue__</span>.

* Go to the ``mean`` data step (if its not open already then double click on the ``mean`` data step)

![](images/mean_step_url.png)

* Copy the URL and identify the workflowId and stepId.

The URL structure is https://tercen.com/core/index.html#ds/{workflowId}/{stepId}

where workflowId and stepId is a hexadecimal number(with hyphens).

An illustrative example (see figure above) is given:
``https://tercen.com/core/#ds/17e8d105a6da4ee5e576f271c53a91ff/d5ed0600-84b0-11e7-f956-43d96268b27b``

In the above URL, workflowId = ``17e8d105a6da4ee5e576f271c53a91ff`` and stepId = ``d5ed0600-84b0-11e7-f956-43d96268b27b``.

Your URL will be different and therefore so will the workflowId and stepId. Please identify these two identifiers in your actual URL.

* Install rtercen package

```
devtools::install_github("tercen/rtercen", ref = "2.10")
```

* Load the appropriate libraries
```
library(rtercen)
library(plyr)
```

* Replace the long string of Xs (length 32) and the long string of Ys (length 36) indicated below with the actual workflowId and stepId values you identified previously.

```
workflowId = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
stepId = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
```
* Create a Tercen client object using your actual username and password and replace ``UUUUUU`` and ``PPPPPP`` using them.

```
client = TercenClient$new("UUUUUU"", "PPPPPP")
```

* Get the cube query defined by your workflow
```
query = client$getCubeQuery(workflowId, stepId)
# inspect query as json
# query$toJson()
```
* Execute the query and get the data
```
cube = query$execute()
```
* Get the data as a data frame
```
df <- cube$sourceTable$as.data.frame()
```
* Execute some computation
```
computed.df <- ddply(df, c(".ids"), summarize, mean = mean(.values))
```
In this instance it is a mean operator.

* Send the result to Tercen
```
query$setResult(computed.df)
```
* Go to the ``crabs workflow`` and refresh the page

The ``mean`` data step should now be green. Even though the execution has taken place locally on your computer.

* Open the ``mean results`` data step and check the results. It should be the same results view as when the operator was run on before on the Tercen server.
